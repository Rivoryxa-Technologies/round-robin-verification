# Recorded review: 15 September 2026

Source revision: `0e713e8772b886bccce8462456b09e55e0079d6b`. Logs were produced from a separate local clone of this revision on macOS arm64 with Python 3.9.6 and Icarus/vvp 13.0. Source SHA-256 values are in [summary.json](summary.json).

- 15 correct configurations passed.
- 1 deliberately broken configurations failed with their required diagnostic.
- 8 Python runner regression tests passed independently.
- Individual simulation process times: 0.0098 to 0.0118 seconds. Compilation is recorded separately in the summary. These timings describe this machine and run, not engineering effort or a client delivery estimate.

Rerun the full matrix from the repository root with `python3 tools/run.py`. See the root README for prerequisites and parameter scope. Generated binaries are omitted from this snapshot; every run compiles its own.

The default correct RTL also passed Yosys synthesis and `check -assert`. [synthesis.log](synthesis.log) records the tool version and command. This is a structural synthesis check, not a formal proof, timing closure, or evidence for every parameter.

```sh
yosys -Q -T -p 'read_verilog -sv rtl/round_robin_arbiter.sv; hierarchy -check -top round_robin_arbiter; synth -top round_robin_arbiter; check -assert'
```
